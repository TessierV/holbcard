## Overview: 
"To practice using Figma, I created a project of interactive cards. I designed several cards following my school's graphic charter, with different colors, fonts, and layouts. Then, I created this website to showcase the cards and their integration into a web environment. This project helped me strengthen my skills in web design and development. I hope you enjoy my work!"

## Install
"To run this project locally, you'll need to clone the repository and run ``npm install`` to install the necessary dependencies."

## Status of the project
- finish

## Note
The "RNCP" holocard doesn't have the holographic effect on GitHub Pages because it's in GIF format. GitHub Pages doesn't support certain features, some animations or dynamic effects may not be present.
